# Questions - Answers

There are a lot of great form services like Wufoo or Survey Monkey, but it's an idea that can improved upon still.

This is an attempt at a smaller feature set that is easy, and fun to use!

I'm pushing myself to do a project with Typescript in order to become more familiar with it. This is a part of that journey.

Screenshots Coming!

An accompanying NodeJS API is also coming soon!

### Desired Feature Set

- Easy log in to save your questions and answers
- Cookie/ID fallback if no acocunt officially created
- Easy auto-magic progress saving
- Offline mode to fall back on/sync when reconnect
- Reordering of questions
  - once a set is "grabbed", zoom the page out by a function of how many questions are and more easily get a birds eye view for sorting
- Field Types in priority order
  - TextArea
  - TextInput
  - EmailInput
  - PhoneInput
    - Auto-detect timezone and determine number format?
  - 1ofX (Radio Style)
  - XofX (Checkbox Style)
